I found myself bored with the work and looking for more challenges. I am an excellent employee and I didn't want my unhappiness to have any impact on the job I was doing for my employer.
There isn't room for growth with my current employer and I'm ready to move on to a new challenge.
I'm looking for a bigger challenge and to grow my career, but didn’t feel like I could give equal attention both to my job search and to my full-time work responsibilities. It didn’t seem ethical to slack off from my former job in order to conduct my job search, and so I left the company.
I was laid off from my last position when our department was eliminated due to corporate restructuring.
I'm relocating to this area due to family circumstances and left my previous position in order to make the move.
I've decided that my current work role is not the direction I want to go in my career and my current employer has no opportunities in the direction I'd like to head.
After several years in my last position, I'm looking for a company where I can contribute and grow in a team-oriented environment.
I am interested in a new challenge and an opportunity to use my technical skills and experience in a different capacity than I have in the past.
I recently received my degree and I want to utilize my educational background in my next position.
I am interested in a job with more responsibility, and I am very ready for a new challenge.
I left my last position in order to spend more time with my family. Circumstances have changed and I'm more than ready for full-time employment again.
I am seeking a position with a stable company with room for growth and opportunity for advancement.
I was commuting to the city and spending a significant amount of time each day on travel. I would prefer to be closer to home.
To be honest, I wasn't considering a move, but I saw this job posting and was intrigued by the position and the company. It sounds like an exciting opportunity and an ideal match with my qualifications.
This position seemed like an excellent match for my skills and experience and I am not able to fully utilize them in my present job.
The company was cutting back and, unfortunately, my job was one of those eliminated.
