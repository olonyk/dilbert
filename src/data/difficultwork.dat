Decisions I have to make within a team are difficult, only because these decisions take more time and require deliberate communication between team members. For example, I was working on a team project, and my colleagues and I had to make a number of choices about how to use our limited budget. Because these decisions involved group conversations, our team learned how to communicate effectively with one another, and I believe we ultimately made the best decisions for the team.
As a manager, the most difficult decisions I make involve layoffs. Before making those tough decisions, I always think carefully about what is best for the business and my employees. While I do not relish making those kinds of choices, I do not shy away from this part of my job. A few years ago, I had to let some employees go due to the economic climate. This was a hard decision that was ultimately necessary for the good of the company and everyone working for the organization.
I find that the hardest decision I have to make is when I have to choose between strong team members for a promotion. There have been occasions when, even though I personally liked one person better than another, I nonetheless had to choose the other person based on their potential to assume the responsibilities of their new role. Sometimes I also had to promote younger employees over staff with seniority, simply because they were more skilled in the use of technology and more willing to work overtime. Itâ€™s never easy, but ultimately you have to think about who will be the most effective and productive in the new position.
