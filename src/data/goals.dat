My long-term goals involve growing with a company where I can continue to learn, take on additional responsibilities, and contribute as much value as I can. I love that your company emphasizes professional development opportunities. I intend to take advantage of all of these.
I see myself as a top-performing employee in a well-established organization, like this one. I plan on enhancing my skills and continuing my involvement in related professional associations.
Once I gain additional experience, I would like to move on from a technical position to management. I know this is a common path for many people in this position. However, for now, I am excited about focusing on and applying my technical skills in this job.
